# Hakuba

[中文版介绍](https://yeungkc.com/post/3)

> Hakuba (白馬村 , Hakuba-mura) is a village located in Nagano Prefecture, Japan.
> If you enjoy hiking or climbing, skiing or other activities, this would be a great place to go (btw I haven't been there yet...)

A **fast** blog starter that reads data off GitHub Discussions.

> _[See how fast it is in action!!](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhakuba.yeungkc.com%2F)_

Please star and [fork](https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba/fork) if you like it!

## How Does It Work

Hakuba fetches the contents on GitHub Discussions with [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) and webhooks.
Then renders the actual blog pages from them.

## Quick Start

Recommended hosting services:

> The output directory named `build`.

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

Deploy with Vercel:  
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsuperyngo%2FHakuba_forked&env=GITHUB_TOKEN,REPOSITORY&envDescription=Configure%20token%20and%20repository%20name%2C%20see%20https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYeungKC%2FHakuba&project-name=blog&repo-name=blog&demo-title=Hakuba&demo-description=A%20fast%20blog%20starter%20driven%20by%20Github%20discussions%20for%20all%20data.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fhakuba.yeungkc.com%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYeungKC%2FHakuba%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fscreenshots.png)

> Hakuba just a blog starter，data and code are completely separated，so you can create a empty repository to write posts and pages discussion， and write a script to clone this repository and build.
>
> The advantage of this is that you can easily deploy your blog and don't need to worry about code updates.

### Configuration

There are various ways to configure it, you can choose to configure it all using environment variables, or partly through discussion.

> If configured blog through discussion, title must be `index`, category must be `CONFIG_CATEGORY`, Here is an [example](https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba/discussions/categories/config).

### Setup GitHub Discussions

Create discussions categories for configurations, posts, and pages. Then Set their format to **Announcement**.

> Hakuba supports mdx and HTML `script` tags for pages and posts, so don't make them public-editable❗❗❗

Only the page named `index` will be used as the main configuration. Here is an [example](https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba/discussions/3).

### Setup Webhooks

If you deployed Hakuba using [vercel](https://vercel.com/), [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), update of the contents could be automated with webhooks when discussions are modified.

- Create a new Deploy Hook.
- Go to the repository settings page to set up the webhook. Select Discussion events.

### Manual Deployment

Clone the repository with `git`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YeungKC/Hakuba.git
```

Then, generate the pages:

```bash
# Run any one of them

yarn build
npm run build
pnpm build
```

Finally, upload the `build` directory to your web server.

#### Update code

If you are using a fork or clone, you need to run the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba.git
git fetch upstream/master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
```

## Additional Settings for Pages and Posts

Pages and posts support Markdown front matter for metadata and configuration overrides.

### Front matter for pages

Added page will be displayed in navigation.

> If you added page title is `__error`, it will be replaced the error page.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba/discussions/58)

| name     | desc                                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| lang     | Language of the post in the form of html language attribute |
| comment  | Whether to enable comments                                  |
| priority | Priority for indexing                                       |
| path     | Path to the page, use all lowercase title by default        |
| excerpt  | Excerpt of the page for SEO metadata                        |

### Post front matter

Here is an [example](https://github.com/YeungKC/Hakuba/discussions/58)

| name      | desc                                                                                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lang      | Language of the post in the form of html language tag                                           |
| comment   | Whether to enable comments                                                                      |
| path      | Path to the post, use discussion number by default                                              |
| excerpt   | Excerpt of the page for SEO metadata                                                            |
| title     | Title of the post. Hakuba uses the title of the discussion post at default.                     |
| published | Date published. Hakuba uses the date of the discussion post at default.                         |
| updated   | Date updated. Hakuba uses the latest date of modification of the discussion post at default.    |
| timezone  | Timezone of `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString(locals, options)`, `config.TIMEZONE` at default. |

#### Limitations

Because use [Mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/) to preprocess the markdown, the following limitations apply:

> In markdown you can begin a code block by indenting 4 spaces. This doesn’t work in mdsvex as indentation is common with XML-based languages. Indenting 4 spaces will do nothing.

see also: <https://mdsvex.com/docs#limitations>

## Dependabot Auto Merge

This project uses [action-dependabot-auto-merge](https://github.com/ahmadnassri/action-dependabot-auto-merge#token-scope) for updating dependencies automatically. If there is a CI failure, try to configure Dependabot secrets.

## Migrate

Clone this repository, configure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REPOSITORY` environment variables, install dependencies with package manager and run:

```bash
# Run any one of them

npm run generateData
yarn generateData
pnpm generateData
```

The post path is `src/routes/post/_source/[discussion number].md` and the page path is `src/routes/_page/[title].md`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Design a logo.
